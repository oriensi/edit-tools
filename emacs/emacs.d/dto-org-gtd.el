;;; Commentary:

;; There are several articles about using GTD (GettingThingsDone) with
;; OrgMode. I'm publishing mine as an Emacs Lisp source
;; file.

;; This is a very basic example org-and-gtd setup. It's also my real
;; configuration, so you can load it yourself or just take a few
;; pieces.

;;; Code:

(require 'org)
(setq gtd-path "~/GTD")

;; I have a nice Wacom tablet, so I like to use the mouse. Org-mouse
;; adds various clickable menus to org-mode constructs.
(require 'org-mouse)

;; I want files with the extension ".org" to open in org-mode.
;; (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.org$" . org-mode))

;; I keep almost everything in one big org file.
;; I open my gtd file when I hit C-c g
(defvar org-gtd-file (concat gtd-path "/newgtd.org"))
(defun gtd ()
  "Open the GTD file."
  (interactive)
  (find-file org-gtd-file))

;; Some basic keybindings.
(global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
(global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
;; (global-set-key "\C-cr" 'org-remember)
(global-set-key "\C-cg" 'gtd)
(global-set-key "\C-cc" 'org-capture)

;; This seems like a good basic set of keywords to start out with:

(setq org-use-fast-todo-selection t)
;; (setq org-todo-keywords '((type "TODO" "NEXT" "WAITING" "DONE")))
(setq org-todo-keywords
      (quote ((sequence "TODO(t!)" "NEXT(n)" "|" "DONE(d@/!)")
              (sequence "PROJECT(p)" "|" "DONE(d!/!)" "CANCELLED(c@/!)")
              (sequence "WAITING(w@/!)" "HOLD(h)" "|" "CANCELLED(c@/!)")
              (sequence "SOMEDAY(s)"))))

;; Some projects need their own org files, but I still want them to
;; show up in my agenda.

(defvar org-gtd-other-files)
(setf org-gtd-other-files (list
                           (concat gtd-path "/projects/third-part-monitor.org")
                           (concat gtd-path "/remember.org")
                           (concat gtd-path "/reading.org")))
(setf org-agenda-files (cons org-gtd-file org-gtd-other-files))
;; (setq org-agenda-files (list "/Users/creamidea/Documents/GTD/project"))

;; When I'm using org to track issues in a project, I use these
;; keywords on a file-local basis:

;; #+SEQ_TODO: TODO | DONE
;; #+SEQ_TODO: REPORT BUG KNOWNCAUSE | FIXED
;; #+SEQ_TODO: | CANCELLED

;; The lisp version is:

;; (setq org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO" | "DONE")
;;                        (sequence "REPORT" "BUG" "KNOWNCAUSE" | "FIXED")
;;                        (sequence | "CANCELLED")))

;; Easy basic searches. Get a quick view of nextactions, etc

(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("w" todo "WAITING" nil)
        ("n" todo "NEXT" nil)
        ("d" "Agenda + Next Actions" ((agenda) (todo "NEXT")))))

;; I use org's tag feature to implement contexts.

(setq org-tag-alist '(("STUDIO" . ?s) ;; company studio office
                      ("PROJECT" . ?p) ;; difference task at company
                      ("HOME" . ?h) ;; home
                      ("MAIL" . ?m) ;; mail somebody
                      ("LUNCHTIME" . ?l) ;; breakfast lunchtime dinner onway etc. (rest)
                      ("TOURISM" . ?t) ;; tourism or not at home/company and any where
                      ("COMPUTER" . ?c)
                      ;; ("FIELD" . ?f)
                      ("READING" . ?r))) ;; reading

;; I like to color-code task types.

(setf org-todo-keyword-faces
      '(("NEXT" . (:foreground "yellow" :background "red" :bold t :weight bold))
        ("TODO" . (:foreground "cyan" :bold t :weight bold))
        ;; ("TODO" . (:foreground "cyan" :background "steelblue" :bold t :weight bold))
        ("STARTED" . (:foreground "springgreen" :bold t :weight bold))
        ("CANCELLED" . (:foreground "#DC143C" :bold t :weight bold))
        ("WAITING" . (:foreground "yellow" :bold t :weight bold))
        ;; ("WAITING" . (:foreground "yellow" :background "magenta2" :bold t :weight bold))
        ("DEFERRED" . (:foreground "deepskyblue" :bold t :weight bold))
        ("DONE" . (:foreground "gray50" :background "gray30"))))

;; I put the archive in a separate file, because the gtd file will
;; probably already get pretty big just with current tasks.

(setq org-archive-location "%s_archive::* Archive")

;; Remember support. This creates several files:
;;
;;   ~/todo.org      Where remembered TODO's are stored.
;;   ~/journal.org   Timestamped journal entries.
;;   ~/remember.org  All other notes

;; and a keybinding of "C-c r" for making quick notes from any buffer.

;; These bits of Remembered information must eventually be reviewed
;; and filed somewhere (perhaps in gtd.org, or in a project-specific
;; org file.) The out-of-sight, out-of-mind rule applies here---if I
;; don't review these auxiliary org-files, I'll probably forget what's
;; in them.
